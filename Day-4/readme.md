## Day 4 (September 27th, 5:30pm-6:30pm IST)
* Topics:
  * Part 1: Introduction and H-R diagrams
  * Part 2: Stellar Evolution
  * Trivia/Quiz contest
  
    Abstract: The talk will centre around the 'quest' for understanding stars. I will discuss some fundamental questions of this quest and the related research fields. I will start by discussing stellar spectra and H-R diagrams. Then I will discuss the evolution of stars depending on their mass from birth to death using HR diagrams and discuss the mysterious compact stars at the end. We will also have an interactive trivia component at the end to discuss some extra topics.
* Instructions:
  * There are no prerequisites. Class 11-12 physics knowledge would suffice. Just learn and have fun!
