These instructions work if you are working on the Terminal of an Ubuntu system. For Windows people, you can always download the Ubuntu terminal from th App Store.

1. Download and install bilby. The instructions are give here: https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby/installation.html

2. Once done, you should try executing the file 150914.py. Just make sure that 150914.py and GW150914.prior are in the same directory.

3. These runs typically take 2-3 days to complete. So, instead of just executing:

python 150914.py

Do,

nohup python 150914.py &

This will ensure that the program execution does not stop when you close the terminal window.  However, your PC must be runnin for the entire duration.

*Note: This is the curse of parameter estimation- it takes a lot of time. THis is why we usually do it using multiple cores on clusters and supercomputers.
