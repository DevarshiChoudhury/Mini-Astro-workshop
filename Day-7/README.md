## Day 7 (October 4th 6:30pm- 7:30pm IST)
* Topic
  * Star Formation-1
  * Abstract: Star formation is a fascinating subject and lies at the heart of galaxy formation/evolution and planet formation. Star formation is a multi-scale, multi-physics problem. I will be introducing the physical processes studied in star formation, and also explain why it has been difficult to obtain a rigorous theory of star formation. If time permits, I will talk a bit about some interesting results from my own research using numerical simulations run on supercomputers. I will end with a brief review of some of the open questions in the field.

  * Just enjoy the talk
