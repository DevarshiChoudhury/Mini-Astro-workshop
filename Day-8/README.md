## Day 8 (October 5th 6:30pm- 7:30pm IST)
* Topic
  * Star Formation-2
  * Abstract: Following the introductory talk - Star Formation 1. This one one will build on an empirical introduction of various Star Formation Laws and the     Initial Mass Function (IMF). Explaining the IMF remains one of the big open problems in star formation and is an active area of research. Following this, I will then talk about my work that introduces stochasticity in the IMF and it's implications on future observational studies.
