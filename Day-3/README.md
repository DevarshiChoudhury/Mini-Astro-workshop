## Day 3 (September 27th, 4:30pm-5:30pm IST)
* Topics:
  * Part 1: Fundamentals of Astrodynamics
    Abstract: Astrodynamics is the study of dynamics of man-made objects in orbit around the earth, moving under the effect of natural and artificial forces. This part of the talk will cover the fundamentals of Astrodynamics, its history, basic mathematical formulation and key concepts. It will also briefly discuss applications of Astrodynamics to satellite orbits around the earth and their practical significance. 
  * Part 2: Space Situational Awareness
    Abstract: This part of the talk will discuss the emerging field of Space Situational Awareness – to have knowledge about our near-space environment with the goal of minimizing threats to life and property – and examine the threat posed by orbital space debris. 
    
* Instructions:
  * There are no prerequisites. This talk will simply be an introduction to what the field is about. Knowledge of classical mechanics may make it more interesting.
