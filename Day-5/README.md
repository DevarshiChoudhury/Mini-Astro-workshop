## Day 5 and 6 (October 1st, 5:30pm-6:30pm IST and October 2nd,4:30pm-5:30pm IST)
* Topics:
  * Part 1: Introduction to Gravitational waves
  * Part 2: Introduction to GW parameter estimation
  
    Abstract: The talk aims to provide a brief and not-so-technical introduction of gravitational waves (GWs). I will begin by providing an intuitive understanding of GWs and move on to talking about the different sources that can result in the generation of detectable GWs. Then, I will introduce the parameter estimation techniques that are used to obtain relevant information from GW detections. Finally, I will give a brief overview of my research in using GW observations to test general relativity.
