The talk aims to provide a brief and not-so-technical introduction of gravitational waves (GWs). I will begin by providing an intuitive understanding of GWs and move on to talking about the different sources that can result in the generation of detectable GWs. Then, I will introduce the parameter estimation techniques that are used to obtain relevant information from GW detections. Finally, I will give a brief overview of my research in using GW observations to test general relativity.
